Me：It's for me?#profile: painter_surprised
boro-chan：What else? You think I could sell it?#profile: boro_thinking
boro-chan：But. You have to write a 5-star review on Wellp, 25+ words, with pictures. #profile: boro_welcome
boro-chan：Also send out a tweet on Z, hashtag TreasureIceShop hashtag Huanmen hashtag BoroStinkySmellHeavenlyTaste...#profile: boro_glad
Me：(What a complicated request!) But... I don't have a cell phone.#profile: painter_sideSweat
boro-chan：Huh?! No cell phone?#profile: boro_awkward
boro-chan：Ahh, darn it... #profile: boro_mad
Me：(Is she mad?) Sorry, I didn't know...#profile: painter_concerned
Me：Perhaps I could pay for the DIY...#profile: painter_mournful
boro-chan：Promise me that you'll <color=green>mention Boro-chan to five different people</color>.#profile: boro_thinking
// 之后海名对话结束也有提起boro酱的option
Me：(<color=green>mention Boro to five people</color>? That wouldn't be hard, I feel.) Promise.#profile: painter_side
boro-chan：That's more like it. I'll post the photo myself, and if your ice is the most popular in five days, you can still come for the Grand Prize.#profile: boro_welcome
//【伏笔：再次找到boro酱的时候，主角让他开口的契机或许是奖励的事；或者鱼头人再次出现卖刨冰的时候，可以来兑奖。】

boro-chan：Boro-chan is me, so I only know how to play Boro-chan.#profile: boro_glad
