All my drawing materials are gone.\n\nMe：I probably can't draw. I mean, without my supplies.\n\n8-2：You're literally penniless, painter. You always surprise me.\n\n8-2：But you can't draw without <color=magenta>drawing materials</color>?\n\n8-2：You <b>used to</b> be better than that.\n\n8-2：Why don't you look around first? Is there really nothing you could use to draw?\n\nMe：(Huh. Tissue paper, pencil, soy sauce... These could work!）<color=green>*Click to pick up items on the table*</color>\n\nSystem：The collected <color=magenta>items</color> could be used as <color=magenta>drawing materials</color>--canvas, brush, and paint.\n\nSystem：Note that there are special items that cannot be used as drawing material.\n\nSystem：Each time you use an item, its <color=magenta>durability</color> will be reduced by 1 point. When the <color=magenta>durability</color> is cleared, the item will <color=magenta>break</color>.\n\nSystem：Some of the brushes include paint. Using them would cost 2 durability points.\n\nSystem：As an item's durability reduces, its displacement value will change.\n\nMe：(These stuff are good enough for doodling, but for a commission...) Is it really okay with you if I paint with soy sauce?\n\n8-2：Of course! Play around and blow me away with something that isn't boring.\n\nSystem：Different drawing materials will have different effects on the image, with four attributes--stable, organic, experimental, and premium.\n\nSystem：Using materials with different attributes will affect the earnings of the current commission. Try to pick something according to the customer's preference!\n\nSystem：You can now choose the drawing material.\n\nMe：(If \"<color=magenta>blow me away</color>\" count as a demand, I should probably use some <color=magenta>experimental</color> materials. Of course, the choice is still mine. There's nothing smoother than pencils after all.)\n\nMe：(The materials I have now are still too limited, let's make do with what we have. Should be enough with 8-2 anyways.）\n\nMe：（...I just sounded like I know 8-2 well? Weird. Now, let's decide what to draw.)\n\nMe：Portrait, right？\n\n8-2：The usual. Of course.\n\n8-2：......\n\n8-2：What are you doing with your brush? Don't tell me you're going to fool me with a quick sketch.\n\n8-2：Stop! You should express your deeeeeep understanding of me. As you used to say, \"Drawing is the accurate description of an object!\"\n\n8-2：I don't want to see what's in front of you right now, but the essential ME, the ME from before, the <b>real</b> ME.\n\nMe：Eh, like when you were younger?\n\n8-2：.........\n\nMe：......\n\nMe：My apologies.\n\n8-2：*sigh*Take it slowly.\n\nMe：(...perhaps I am being a bit too hasty.)\n\nMe：(The first step of drawing is <color=magenta>observation</color>. Besides the rigid proportionality, I should capture the essence of my <color=magenta>object</color>.)\n\nMe：(Observe 8-2 closely. Is there anything worth <color=magenta>capturing</color>?）\n\nSystem：In the process of drawing, <color=magenta>observation points</color> that can be captured would occur on the screen.\n\nSystem：Click the <color=magenta>left mouse button</color> on an observation point and <color=magenta>drag</color> it into the <color=magenta>conception window</color>, the observation point will be transformed into an <color=magenta>inspiration</color>.\n\nSystem：The painter may hold multiple inspirations at the same time. In this case, you should choose carefully. The inspiration you choose will change the outcome of the painting. It also determines the painter's attitude towards the customer, therefore changing the story between them.\n\nSystem：Present the inspiration on the <color=magenta>canvas</color> to continue drawing.\n\nSystem：The canvas is lighted up. Try dragging and dropping the inspiration onto the canvas!\n\nMe：(Let's observe him to the finest details... Mama! My meal!）\n\nMama：Enjoy!\n\nMama：Hey, is that your friend? Wait, I know you, you're...master eight plus two!\n\n8-2：*cough*Eightminus Tue, sis.\n\nMe：(Pssss...master eight plus two also sounds fine.）\n\nSystem：Sounds, words, and smells could also provide vital information for conceptualizing the painting. Observation points could occur anywhere on the screen, don't limit your observation to the object of painting alone.\n\nSystem：You need to capture some of the observation points to continue drawing.\n\nMama：Yes, of course, excuse my bad memory, master, such a pleasure--my lover is absorbed by your lectures!\n\nSystem：In addition to mandatory observation points, there are also optional ones that could be <color=magenta>missed</color> as the dialog develops, limiting the direction of the story. Missing isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you should always look out for an unexpected observation point.\n\nSystem：That's all about observation points--don't forget to catch them if you can!\n\nMama：I was so worried when he quit the fishing job, but thanks to our master here, we're rich now.\n\nMama：Ah, by displacement, our earnings tripled! You saved my family, master...\n\n8-2：You're welcome, sister. Me, I don't have many hobbies. I just enjoy helping others so much.\n\nMama：Such kind-hearted, master. Here's our best Oolong tea, just for you! Let me know what you'd like for dinner, I'll give you 40% off everything.\n\n8-2：Only have to pay Sixty percent for everything? Ha, I really should've changed my name to Eightminus Seven.\n\nMama：Hahaha... Master, that was a very cold joke.\n\nMama：Please take your time to look at the menu, call me if you need anything.\n\n8-2：Heh, look at my lovely fans! Maybe I should start paying attention to my public image.\n\n8-2：...No shit bro, you've already wolfed it all down?\n\nMe：I was hungry... Now I'm full.\n\nMe：(Eating while taking a commission was unprofessional. I should really start concentrating on the object.）\n\nMe：So, what does \"master\" do for a living?\n\n8-2：I'm a mathematician.\n\nMe：You taught Mama's lover...maths?\n\n8-2：Oh, that's just a part-time job. Maths is a fundamental subject. Numbers are the basic units that make up the world.\n\n8-2：1 means is, 0 means is not.\n\n8-2：1 is true, 0 is false。\n\n8-2：Studying existence and truth is my occupation. Just like you're a painter, I'm a mathematician.\n\nMe：(That sounds crazier than my \"inquiry into the nature of art\".) You mean that you're self-appointed.\n\nMe：This talk about 1 and 0 sounds familiar, isn't that called numerology or something?\n\n8-2：Well, well, that's your understanding? Shallow, ah.\n\n8-2：Numbers are crucial! Look at what's on top of your head, yes, right in the middle--that's a very important number.\n\nMe：(A very important number... Huh? Does \"on top of my head\" mean...)\n\nMe：A number on my head? Don't be ridiculous.\n\n8-2：Gee, isn't it 0! Can't you see it?\n\nMe：Huh? 0, that's...\n\nMe：That's the amount of money in my wallet!\n\nMe：How in the world did you know that?\n\n8-2：Told ya, I'm a mathematician.\n\nMe：You're really something.\n\nMe：(I'm pretty sure he peeked at my wallet when I was going through my bag. You can't be too careful with scams these days.)\n\nMe：That's not maths.\n\n8-2：Of course its' maths. There were a lot of meaningful numbers in one's life, but now there's only one left.\n\n8-2：The one that represents <color=magenta>value</color>.\n\n8-2：It's on top of everyone's head, on top of everything. I'm not talking about a price tag. bro. You'll recognize that number when you see one--the elusive one, the one that's unique to everyone.\n\n8-2：Yes! I'm talking about the mythical <color=magenta>value to you</color>. When you displace something, you'll receive that number in cash.\n\n8-2：It's just a number, yet no one can see it clearly.\n\n8-2：That's where my Displacement to Success lecture comes in. You catch what I mean?\n\nMe：Uh-huh, You're a part-time scammer.\n\nMe：(And he laughed when I called him a scammer! Look at <color=green>his smile</color>, how could anyone be so brazen?)\n\nMe：I can't believe you have the nerve to claim that you study the truth. Gosh, you should apologize to Mama.\n\n8-2：Mind your language, painter, how could you call that a scam?\n\n8-2：Few people know what they want and what they can afford to lose. They'd end up displacing everything for nothing.\n\n8-2：I'm just helping them to grasp their fate with their own hands.\n\n8-2：Speaking of which, painter, let's open up. I can feel it--did something similar happened to you?\n\n8-2：If you know yourself better, you wouldn't have ended up in a mess and still know nothing.\n\nMe：......\n\nMe：(When I think about it this way, I did wake up in a weird way today.)\n\nMe：(This dude obviously knows a lot about displacement. Should I listen to what he had to say?)\n\nSystem：There are two different inspirations at hand, and you'll have to make a <color=magenta>choice</color>.\n\nSystem：Choosing different inspirations would determine how the painting looks like as well as the painter's <color=magenta>understanding</color> and <color=magenta>attitude</color> regarding the customer. It might change the future!\n\nMe：(I have to make a choice here... Can I trust 8-2?)\n\nMe：Actually, something weird happened to me today. Would you give me some advice?\n\n8-2：Sure, what happened?\n\nMe：(Did he just smile?)\n\nMe：I woke up today and found my appartment empty. Everything's gone, along with all my money. The worst part? I don't remember a thing.\n\n8-2：Tsk, failed displacement. Displacement accident.\n\nMe：Perhaps. But there should be something coming out of the displacement, right? I'm still confused.\n\n8-2：You didn't find anything at all?\n\nMe：Hmm, I did find something.\n\nMe：Here it is. It's, I think, a fish scale.\n\n8-2：It should be something very, very significant to you, right?\n\nMe：Well, it feels like yes, but I have no idea what it is.\n\n8-2：Yo bro it looks familiar to me.\n\nMe：Really?!\n\n8-2：Eh my eyes hurt, can I take a closer look?\n\nMe：(Right, he must be nearsighted since he wears that huge <color=magenta>pair of glasses</color>.)\n\nMe：(I need to know what it is.)\n\nMe：Please take a good look.*hands over the scale*\n\n8-2：*takes the scale*Yes, yes, let's see...\n\n8-2：......\n\n8-2：.........Opps!\n\n8-2：Hands slipped! Where did it go?\n\nMe：What the... You handle such an important object like that? Let me see, did it fall on the floor...\n\n8-2：Hey, it has fallen into my other hand.\n\nMe：HUH?\n\n8-2：Gotcha! Hahaha~\n\n8-2：Don't be too gullible, painter, it's dangerous. Don't easily hand over something so important to other people.\n\n8-2：I took a good look at it, it's... A fish scale! I'm not sure which type of fish it's from, why don't you ask Mama's lover? He's pretty good at fish stuff.\n\nMe：......just give it back.\n\n8-2：Okay, okay, here you go. I was just kidding, don't be angry.\n\n8-2：......\n\n8-2：*talks to himself* Am I really that obnoxious? Oh my, it's gonna drop from 0.5 to 0.2... No, even lower...\n\n8-2：No way, 0.15?\n\nMe：(This dude is definitely not trustworthy, I shouldn't have trusted him.）What are you mumbling about?\n\n8-2：Heh, I'm glad that you finally asked. It's the second important number in life.\n\n8-2：I call it <color=magenta>ownership</color>.\n\nMe：(U'm just too curious...) What does it mean?\n\n8-2：Do you know the trick of displacement? I mean, the key that determine the success of the displacement.\n\nMe：Equal value?\n\n8-2：That's not all. Say, I think my boss's car worths a lot of money, and I want to displace it for cash. Would it work?\n\nMe：Of course not, the car's not yours.\n\n8-2：BINGO! You can't displace something that's not yours.\n\nMe：Tell me something that's not as apparent.\n\n8-2：Have you ever wondered how the system of displacement-let's say it's a system-determines if something belongs to you?\n\nMe：Something like scent? Like how cats mark and recognize their belongings through smell...\n\n8-2：You mean pheromones?\n\nMe：Something like that.\n\n8-2：Pfft.\n\n8-2：You mean the system judges whether an object is yours through your pheromones. Hahahahaha! Did you learn that from some ABO fanfic?\n\nMe：(Shit. I sounded stupid.) You said pheromones, I didn't.\n\n8-2：Okay, okay.\n\nMe：*sigh* I guess you'll tell me that your answer is \"ownership.\"\n\nMe：\"Ownership determines an object's ownership\" - that's still crap.\n\n8-2：That's a fact. Say, do objects know to whom they belong to?\n\n8-2：Of course not. How ever you question your boss's car, it will not respond.\n\n8-2：But everyone knows that the car belongs to your boss. So it is.\n\n8-2：The concept of \"ownership\" is created, defined, and used only by humans.\n\nMe：Don't be so humancentric, animals could feel like they own something too.\n\n8-2：Fine, humans and animals. In short, ownership is a unwritten rule in the society.\n\n8-2：Displacement knows, displacement is as clever and as stupid as humans. If you want to own something, here's the only way.\n\n8-2：<b>Make everyone believe that you own it</b>.\n\nMe：I could cheat everyone that I own something. Does that count as ownership?\n\n8-2：Of course it does.\n\n8-2：So, here's a question: is it possible to own a person?\n\nMe：......\n\n8-2：Yes, it is-as long as your ownership can convince everyone: know everything about them, accurately describe all their traits.\n\n8-2：And most importantly, win their full, 100%, <b>trust</b>. Not the casual type of trust, but the form of trust that make them believe that they belongs to you.\n\nMe：That sounds toxic, if not impossible.\n\n8-2：Think about it. Don't you \"have\" your Family, lover, friend?\n\n8-2：\"I'm yours\"-doesn't it sound familiar and romantic?\n\n8-2：Not to say that most people were born with a person--\n\nMe：The self.\n\n8-2：Correct, the self. Although some could also lose their selves as time passes.\n\n8-2：Now, you should understand the second important number--\n\n8-2：<color=magenta>Ownership</color>. When it applies to other people, it would be the number that represents the total of your understanding of them and their trust in you.\n\n8-2：100% of understanding times 100% of trust: the perfect 100! You don't have to reach perfection, 90 is good enough for displacement.\n\n8-2：Unfortunately, painter, I could see that you have around 0% of trust in me. Stop being so worried, I can't own you, so I can't harm you.\n\nMe：You do know that you sound evil?\n\n8-2：Ah crap, you think I'm terrible!\n\n8-2：I don't want a crafty-looking portrait! Wait, before you finish, let me rescue my image in your mind.\n\nMe：Don't worry about that, I'm about to finish the last strokes.\n\n8-2：All to the fate, I guess?\n\nMe：As you've been asking a lot of questions, now I think it's my turn.\n\n8-2：Ah I'm nervous. Do...do...do ask.\n\nMe：(I am pretty sure about 8-2's portrait. My question is...)\n\nMe：Have you ever been owned by someone else?\n\n8-2：......\n\n8-2：Why the question?\n\nMe：You've been talking about handling oneself and manipulating others, as if you were superior.\n\nMe：Do you understand how it feels to be owned?\n\n8-2：Hey, it goes without saying.\n\n8-2：Of course I understand. Many people own me. They could displace me whenever they like.\n\n8-2：Being owned is risky but also happy. People who has never been owned are sad, you know. Their lives have relatively failed.\n\n8-2：...What, are you impressed? Heh, that was a good one, I'll write it down for my next lecture...\n\nMe：It's not like, that good.\n\n我：But I liked that. Perhaps the intuition of an artist.\n\nMe：The painting is almost finished, good luck with your lectures, it's fun talking with you but I've got things to do...\n\nMe：(Right, I had to meet someone, and I almost forgot.)\n\nMe：(Wednesday, Aug. 26th. I've got a friend who's coming from far awary, and we promised to meet up at HotMama... Wait, that's right here.)\n\nMe：...Wait.\n\nMe：The old friend I'm meeting is you?\n\nMe：Darn bro, how long has it been? You've changed <b>so much</b>! I didn't even recognize you.\n\n8-2：*sigh* It's only been a few weeks, painter.\n\nMe：Hey, I've been stupid. I didn't even remember that I promised to meet up.\n\nMe：You scared me when you just...poped up! Where have you been?\n\nMe：You didn't even have your cloths on when you just...appeared! When I think about it, how did you ever get on public transportation like that?\n\n8-2：I didn't take public transportation. I haven't even left the town.\n\n8-2：Or should I say, I wen to <color=magenta>the other side</color>. I went to <color=magenta>the Void</color>.\n\nMe：You...you died?\n\n8-2：No you idot. I was only on a work trip.\n\nMe：...Huh?\n\nMe：You mean...\n\nMe：You were displaced by somebody, for work?\n\n8-2：Uh-huh.\n\nMe：(That's hell of a crazy job, but it's true that he had <color=magenta>disappeared</color> and reappeared!)\n\nMe：(Disappearing and reappearing <color=magenta>take time</color>. That's why I didn't remember him when he poped up.)\n\nMe：How did you come back, then?\n\n8-2：That's a top secret at our <color=magenta>One in Seven Fraternity</color>.\n\nMe：...\n\n8-2：I could tell you, though, if you're interested in becoming our reserve.\n\nMe：Ummmmm... (Sounds like a very demanding, crazy job.)\n\n8-2：Painter, you're too cautious. Okay, I'll reveal just a bit.\n\n8-2：So. In short, once in a while. we displace each other for a large amount of liquid asset. That's called a work trip.\n\n8-2：Since it's a work trip, there would, of course, be a day when the trip ends. At that day the displaced member would come back.\n\nMe：............(Now it sounds like a terrible, vicious, crazy job with extremely high risks.)\n\nMe：But how's that possible?\n\nMe：How could something come back to existence from disappearance?\n\n8-2：But why not?\n\nMe：Nobody could remember the things that have disappeared, isn't it?\n\n8-2：Heh.\n\nMe：Hey, tell me what it's like on the other side.\n\n8-2：It'd not be called \"the Void\" if there's anything there except the void.\n\n8-2：Take a step back, I wouldn't be able to remember anything. Only the non-existent goes to the void. I didn't even exist, how could I know? Well, I guess you could also say that I didn't go anywhere. The Void is metaphorical, you see.\n\nMe：Fine. No comments.\n\nMe：(Yet the existence...the non-existence of the Void is captivating. There's nothing and everything at the same time.)\n\nMe：(Something still feels missing, though.)\n\nMe：(But anyways, the portrait of 8-2 is already finished.)\n\n：\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n","drawBinaryVal":0,"mapPlayerPos":{"x":0.0,"y":0.0,"z":0.0},"mapItemCollectedState":[]}
